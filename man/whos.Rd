\arguments{\item{pattern}{Regexp filtering of objects. Only objects matching the pattern
are displayed. Optional, default: show all objects.}
\item{envir}{Environment, data frame or list to be displayed. Optional,
default: globalenv()}
\item{exclude}{A list of objects not to be displayed. To set a default exclusion
mask use the \code{whos.set.mask} function. If \code{whos.set.mask} is
called without a list of object names all objects currently in globalenv()
are hidden. This is useful for example if you have a lot of stuff in the
workspace that you aren't currently interested in but is needed to make
your code run.}
\item{lst}{List of object names. These will be hidden from view.}
